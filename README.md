###Data Warehousing and Business Intelligence Project

Overview
This repository encompasses my comprehensive Data Warehousing and Business Intelligence projects undertaken during my academic journey. For my initial project, I utilized the Online Shopping Dataset as the focal point for my academic requirements. However, due to dataset errors, the Business Intelligence aspect couldn't be completed as intended.

In response, I embarked on a subsequent project using the AMD Expo dataset, a more robust and reliable dataset. This initiative served both my academic pursuits and personal knowledge enhancement. The projects presented here showcase my proficiency in the realms of Data Warehousing and Business Intelligence.


Technologies and Tools Utilized
Database: Microsoft SQL Server
Development Environment: Visual Studio
Reporting Tool: SQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS)
